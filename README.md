# Tekano_Mbonani_Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. 

I wanted a prefessional platform to present career achievements, milestones and other highlights, so I built one for myself. This is a portfolio where I can present my educational becakground, career history, projects and more. This also provides more information than other portfolio platforms where one does not have full control. This project will grow as my career grows, allowing the addition of latest developments without having to remove any from the past.
